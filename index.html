      <p>During the spring of 2017, I was fortunate enough to visit Japan, this time as a tourist. I had visited Japan many times before but mostly for business. This time, it was all about site seeing, eating good food and experiencing the Japanese culture at its best.</p>

      <p>My family and I stayed for about a week. We really enjoyed seeing all the pink cherry blossoms (sakura) blooming at the parks. What we really didn't enjoy were the high prices of the food and souvenirs - boy do things cost a lot in Japan! Overall it was a great trip and I'd love to do it again soon.</p>
